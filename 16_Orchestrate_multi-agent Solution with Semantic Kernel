Orchestrate a multi-agent solution using Semantic Kernel

Hypthetical Scenario ( MS Learn Documentation)
-------------------------------------------------
🥨Imagine you're trying to address common DevOps challenges such as monitoring application performance, identifying issues, and deploying fixes. A multi-agent system could consist of four specialized agents working collaboratively:

The Monitoring Agent continuously ingests logs and metrics, detects anomalies using natural language processing (NLP), and triggers alerts when issues arise.
The Root Cause Analysis Agent then correlates these anomalies with recent system changes, using machine learning models or predefined rules to pinpoint the root cause of the problem.
Once the root cause is identified, the Automated Deployment Agent takes over to implement fixes or roll back problematic changes by interacting with CI/CD pipelines and executing deployment scripts.
Finally, the Reporting Agent generates detailed reports summarizing the anomalies, root causes, and resolutions, and notifies stakeholders via email or other communication channels.

Goal : 
😎Build AI agents using the Semantic Kernel SDK
😎Use tools and plugins with your AI agents
😎Understand different types of orchestration patterns
😎Develop multi-agent solutions
