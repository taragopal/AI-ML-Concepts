Using asynchronous calls : Whenever you want to call Azure AI Document Intelligence, you must start by connecting and authenticating with the service in your Azure subscription. 
To make that connection, you need:
  -- The service endpoint. This value is the URL where the service is published.
  -- The API key. This value is a unique key that grants access.


/*----------------------------------------------------------
poller = document_analysis_client.begin_analyze_document(
        "prebuilt-layout", AnalyzeDocumentRequest(url_source=docUrl
    ))
result: AnalyzeResult = poller.result()
----------------------------------------------------------*/

How can access Azure Document Intelligence services? 
-----------------------------------------------------
A REST API
Client library SDKs
Azure Document Intelligence Studio
Azure AI Foundry

How to train a custom model? 

I. Store sample forms in an Azure blob container, along with JSON files containing layout and label field information.
    --  You can generate an ocr.json file for each sample form using the Azure Document Intelligence's Analyze document function. Additionally, you need a single fields.json file describing the fields you want
to extract, and a labels.json file for each sample form mapping the fields to their location in that form.
II. Generate a shared access security (SAS) URL for the container.
III. Use the Build model REST API function (or equivalent SDK method).
IV. Use the Get model REST API function (or equivalent SDK method) to get the trained model ID.

OR

Use the Azure Document Intelligence Studio to label and train. There are two types of underlying models for custom forms custom template models or custom neural models.
  -- Custom template models accurately extract labeled key-value pairs, selection marks, tables, regions, and signatures from documents. Training only takes a few minutes, and more than 100 languages are supported.
  -- Custom neural models are deep learned models that combine layout and language features to accurately extract labeled fields from documents.This model is best for semi-structured or unstructured documents.


To extract form data using a custom model, use the analyze document function of either a supported SDK, or the REST API, while supplying model ID (generated during model training). This function starts the form
analysis. which you can then request the result to get the analysis.

#Python CODE: 
/*----------------------------------------------------------
endpoint = "YOUR_DOC_INTELLIGENCE_ENDPOINT"
key = "YOUR_DOC_INTELLIGENCE_KEY"

model_id = "YOUR_CUSTOM_BUILT_MODEL_ID"
formUrl = "YOUR_DOCUMENT"

document_analysis_client = DocumentAnalysisClient(
    endpoint=endpoint, credential=AzureKeyCredential(key)
)

# Make sure your document's type is included in the list of document types the custom model can analyze
task = document_analysis_client.begin_analyze_document_from_url(model_id, formUrl)
result = task.result()
------------------------------------------------------------*/

A successful JSON response contains analyzeResult that contains the content extracted and an array of pages containing information about the document content.

What needs to be done to train a custom model and use it to extract data with custom models in Azure AI ? 

Create an Azure Document Intelligence or Azure AI Services resource
Collect at least 5-6 sample forms for training and upload them to your storage account container.
Configure cross-domain resource sharing (CORS). CORS enables Azure Document Intelligence Studio to store labeled files in your storage container.
Create a custom model project in Azure Document Intelligence Studio. You'll need to provide configurations linking your storage container and Azure Document Intelligence or Azure AI Service resource to the project.
Use Azure Document Intelligence Studio to apply labels to text.
Train your model. Once the model is trained, you'll receive a Model ID and Average Accuracy for tags.
Test your model by analyzing a new form that wasn't used in training.
