One of the core features of the Semantic Kernel SDK is that it allows developers to combine native code with the power of large language models (LLMs). Plugins encapsulate your functions and allow them to be used by the AI. This enables your AI the ability to perform actions that it wouldn't otherwise be able to do.

Suppose you want to create a smart traffic routing system in a city. You can add plugin functions to your kernel that can interact with a daily passengers, number of fleets to a source and destination, and modes of transportation, weather disruptions, local law and order information from police, possible events and large gathering and aggregate all these to deploy a traffic routing system.
