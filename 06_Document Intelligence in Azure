Azure Document Intelligence (formerly known as Azure Form Recognizer) is a powerful cloud-based Azure AI service that uses advanced machine learning to extract text, key-value pairs, tables, and structures from documents automatically and accurately. Its primary purpose is to transform unstructured or semi-structured data from various document types into structured, usable data, enabling organizations to automate business processes, improve data-driven decisions, and enhance document search capabilities.
Essentially, it goes beyond simple Optical Character Recognition (OCR) by understanding the context and relationships within a document.

Key Capabilities and Features:

Optical Character Recognition (OCR):
The foundational layer. It accurately extracts printed and handwritten text from images and PDF documents, making unsearchable PDFs into searchable ones. This is the "reading" part.

Layout Analysis:
Beyond just text, it understands the overall layout and structure of a document. It can extract text along with information about paragraphs, lines, words, their bounding box locations, and roles (e.g., header, footer, page number).
Crucially, it also detects and extracts tables and selection marks (checkboxes, radio buttons), preserving their structure and content.

Key-Value Pair Extraction:
This is where "intelligence" comes in. The service can identify and extract common fields (e.g., "Invoice Number:", "Total:") and their corresponding values ("INV-2023-001", "$150.00"). It understands the semantic relationship between a label and its associated value, even if they are visually separated.

Prebuilt Models:
Azure Document Intelligence offers pre-trained, domain-specific models for common document types, which means you can use them out-of-the-box without any custom training.
Examples:

Invoices: Extracts invoice ID, customer details, vendor details, due date, line items, total amount, tax, etc.
Receipts: Extracts merchant name, transaction date, total amount, itemized purchases.
Identity Documents: Extracts details from passports, driver's licenses (e.g., name, date of birth, document number, expiration date).
Contracts: Extracts agreement parties, effective dates, terms.
Tax Forms (e.g., US W-2, 1099): Extracts relevant tax information.
Health Insurance Cards, Bank Statements, Business Cards, Checks: And many more.

Custom Models:
If your documents have unique or highly specific layouts that aren't covered by prebuilt models, you can train your own custom models. This involves providing a few sample documents (as few as 5) and labeling the fields you want to extract using the Document Intelligence Studio.

Custom Extraction Models: 
Trained to extract specific labeled fields from documents. Can be Template models (for documents with consistent visual layouts) or Neural models (for documents with varying or mixed layouts).

Custom Classification Models: Trained to identify the type of document (e.g., distinguish between an invoice, a purchase order, and a delivery note) before sending it to the appropriate extraction model.

Composed Models: You can combine multiple custom models into a single "composed" model, allowing you to process different variations of documents (e.g., invoices from different vendors) with a single API call.

Document Intelligence Studio:
A web-based portal that provides a no-code/low-code visual interface to:
Explore and test prebuilt models.
Upload your own documents and analyze them.
Label documents to train custom models.
View the extracted data in a structured (JSON) format.
Get sample code snippets for integrating into applications.

Output Format:
The extracted data is returned in a structured JSON format, making it easy to integrate with databases, business applications, and workflows (e.g., Power Automate, Azure Logic Apps).
Each extracted field comes with a confidence score, indicating the model's certainty about the extraction.
