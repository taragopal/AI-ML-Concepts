Orchestrate a multi-agent solution using Semantic Kernel

Hypthetical Scenario ( MS Learn Documentation)
-------------------------------------------------
🥨Imagine you're trying to address common DevOps challenges such as monitoring application performance, identifying issues, and deploying fixes. A multi-agent 
system could consist of four specialized agents working collaboratively:

The Monitoring Agent continuously ingests logs and metrics, detects anomalies using natural language processing (NLP), and triggers alerts when issues arise.
The Root Cause Analysis Agent then correlates these anomalies with recent system changes, using machine learning models or predefined rules to pinpoint the root
cause of the problem. Once the root cause is identified, the Automated Deployment Agent takes over to implement fixes or roll back problematic changes by interacting
with CI/CD pipelines and executing deployment scripts. Finally, the Reporting Agent generates detailed reports summarizing the anomalies, root causes, and 
resolutions, and notifies stakeholders via email or other communication channels.

Goal : 
😎Build AI agents using the Semantic Kernel SDK
😎Use tools and plugins with your AI agents
😎Understand different types of orchestration patterns
😎Develop multi-agent solutions


☘️ Supported Orchestration methods for the Semantic Kernel : 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
🎶 Concurrent orchestration - Broadcast the same task to multiple agents at once and collect their results independently. Useful for parallel analysis, independent
subtasks, or ensemble decision making.
When to use? 
1. when tasks can run concurrently 
2. when tasks can benifit from different specialized skills or approaches 
3. Its best to use in voting ( quorum), speedy resolution, brain storming, combining different reasoning methods. 

Avoid : When there are resource constraints, tasks are strictly dependent on sequences, when data cant be shared reliably with extenal entitites, when the task is
too complex and there are competing logic in motion. 

IMPLEMENTATION Flow:  
🪂🚀Define your agents: Create agent instances (for example, ➡️ChatCompletionAgent) with specific instructions and AI services. Each agent specializes in a 
particular domain or skill set.

🪂🚀Set up the concurrent orchestration : Use the ➡️ConcurrentOrchestration class to create an orchestration that can run multiple agents in parallel. Pass your 
agent instances as members to this orchestration.

🪂🚀Start the runtime: Initialize and start an ➡️InProcessRuntime object to manage agent execution and coordination.

🪂🚀 Invoke the orchestration: Call the orchestration's ➡️invoke method with the task or input you want the agents to work on. The orchestration runs all agents 
concurrently.

🪂🚀Collect the results: Gather the output asynchronously from all agents. The results are typically returned as a list, but the order of responses is not 
guaranteed.

Stop the runtime (optional): After processing, cleanly stop the runtime to release resources.

🎶Sequential orchestration - Pass the output from one agent to the next in a fixed order. Ideal for step-by-step workflows, pipelines, and progressive refinement.

Use sequential pattern when : 
------------------------------
Processes made up of multiple steps that must happen in a specific order, where each step relies on the one before it.
Data workflows where each stage adds something important that the next stage needs to work properly.
Tasks where stages can't be done at the same time and must run one after another.
Situations that require gradual improvements, like drafting, reviewing, and polishing content.
Systems where you know how each agent performs and can handle delays or failures in any step without stopping the whole process.

Avoid this pattern when: 
-------------------------
Stages can be run independently and in parallel without affecting quality.
The entire task can be done effectively by a single agent.
Early stages may fail or produce poor output, and there's no way to stop or correct downstream processing based on errors.
Agents need to collaborate dynamically rather than hand off work sequentially.
The workflow requires iteration, backtracking, or dynamic routing based on intermediate results.

IMPLEMENTATION Flow: 
-------------------
🪂🚀Define your agents: Create agent instances (for example, ChatCompletionAgent) with specific instructions and AI services. Each agent should have a clear
responsibility.

🪂🚀Set up the sequential orchestration: Use the SequentialOrchestration class to create an orchestration pipeline that executes agents one after another,
and pass your agent instances to the object. Optionally, add callbacks to observe agent outputs during the sequence.

🪂🚀Start the runtime: Initialize and start an InProcessRuntime object to manage agent execution.

🪂🚀Invoke the orchestration: Call the orchestration's invoke method with the task or input you want the agents to work on. The orchestration processes the task
through all agents sequentially.

🪂🚀Collect the final result: Await and retrieve the final output after all agents have completed their steps.

🪂🚀Stop the runtime (optional): After processing, cleanly shut down the runtime to free resources.

🎶Handoff orchestration - Dynamically transfer control between agents based on context or rules. Great for escalation, fallback, and expert routing where one agent
works at a time.
